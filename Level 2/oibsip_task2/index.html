                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a renowned theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</p>
                <p>Einstein is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc². He received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to Theoretical Physics and his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.</p>
